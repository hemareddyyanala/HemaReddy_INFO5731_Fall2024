Obviously, the plot and script aren't the main focus here. You're not going to the theater or streaming this at home expecting to get emotional or have a life-changing experience. This isn't Schindler's List or Shawshank Redemption, and that's totally fine. Just like there are different colors and flavors, there are different types of movies, and Deadpool is made to entertain, which it does 100%.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman were born to play Deadpool and Wolverine, respectively, and it shows.The lowest point of this movie, besides the plot, is the villain-too forgettable, too bland, and almost evoking no reaction. You don't really feel the threat or hate the character enough to root for your hero or anti-hero to take them down ASAP. There's no backstory or real motive behind their actions. They're just there for Deadpool to overcome, because that's how these movies roll.\",\n          \"I can honestly say that you should wait until it comes on Disney+ instead of going to the theater. I think this movie was super overhyped by Disney and several people who saw it, however I think it definitely fell flat especially as compared to the first two Deadpool movies. Deadpool constantly breaking the fourth wall extremely tiresome and seemed lazy for cheap laughs. The continuous battles between Deadpool and Wolverine did nothing to further the plot (not that there was much plot) and I found them to be a waste of time (you know, since both of them are indestructible). The multiverse/time travel/alternate timeline nonsense that marvel keeps pushing at us is not productive and I think the main point of this movie was to put an end to that, so there's at least one positive thing to come out of this 2 hour waste of time. There were a handful of one liners that made me chuckle, especially where Chris Evan's' short lived cameo was concerned, but for the most part I found this move to be rather lackluster.\",\n          \"Finally!A movie that was real enjoyable to watch. Huge Deadpool fan here and it's just an ongoing gift that keeps on giving including a nice 'cameo' of Stan Lee.The jokes landed perfectly and haven't laughed out loud in a while in the cinema.I kind of dig the new super hero portrayed by Channing Tatum, loved how he was soooo inaudible sometimes :)The only thing that kind of bugged me was the villain and her army of thugs and the fact the Ant-Man corpse wasn't really explained how it got there.Don't get me wrong, Cassandra was well played by the actress but it was a bit meh as a villain (my humble opinion)And another thing, the story is a bit all over the place but it had to be to make this team of Deadpool and Wolverine actually work.I loved how Deadpool basically killed the multiverse and mocked it completely, that was a class of reflection.The scene where Chris Evan's is going to say the 'line' was so much fun!And then there is Wolverine, the best version of it. I am truly impressed how he portrayed this role. That suit, the mask... the movements... it was all there and delivered perfectly.The soundtrack is simply amazing, I really was impressed of the last version of madonna's like a prayer, such an epic scene.I've probably missed a ton of small details, there were so many of them as well as cameo's, so will have to rewatch it again and I really would recommend this movie if you're into Deadpool-style movie.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cleaned_Reviews\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"film fun mixtur multivers nonsens watch loki know time varianc organ deadpool must find wolverin one univers join save world mix charact numer film includ electra jennif garner blade wesley snipe johnni storm chri evansfrom fantast four also captain america henri cavil play superman play anoth charact cassandra nova emma corrin charl twin sister bald evil enemyth film heavi inan fight scene order seriou enjoy film one must deep super hero world film heart warm disney film lot fword homag super hero film credit look sound like disney bought right everyth film miss harley quinnbarbi imagin pun\",\n          \"enjoy deadpool movi go enjoy film protagonist great stori good compel overal enjoy filmth best part movi charact ryan reynold hugh jackman great chemistri togeth side charact memor your surpris lip seal fan xmen happyth stori dialogu downright goofi well engag seriou topic includ mental health breath fresh air problem consequenti someth stake import save day also plenti gori amaz fight scenesproduct valu good consid disney movi theyr foot top dollar movi that fault overal visual effect good edit good soundtrack good especi song fight scene greatoveral stellar movi enjoy deadpool movi your gon na like one\",\n          \"love lettermass joke th centuri fox without substanc thinnest form storytel yet consist hilari lot fun turn brain flashi action impact love lettermass joke th centuri fox without substanc thinnest form storytel yet consist hilari lot fun turn brain flashi action impact love lettermass joke th centuri fox without substanc thinnest form storytel yet consist hilari lot fun turn brain flashi action impact\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Bonkers !!Sooo !...\\nWhat I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The \\\"corridor\\\" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...\",\n          \"I read an IGN review where the guy gave it a 7 because the story was poor.The guy really needs to read the room.You do not go to see Deadpool for a great, in-depth story which will make you think.You go to see Deadpool for fun, for obscene fight scenes, great jokes, bad jokes... Ridiculous deaths, sarcasms, obnoxious non PC comments and most importantly the most amazing music which brings it all together.And Deapool and Wolverine has that on every possible way.If you want to see this film, go to the cinema, don't wait for TV because you will miss one of the biggest and best watches to ever hit the big screen.\",\n          \"We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's \\\"X-Men\\\" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but \\\"Deadpool & Wolverine\\\" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near \\\"fun filler\\\", it's not \\\"Infinity War\\\" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Nouns\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 31,\n        \"min\": 28,\n        \"max\": 103,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          60,\n          28,\n          32\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Verbs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 16,\n        \"max\": 76,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          38,\n          22,\n          76\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Adjectives\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 11,\n        \"min\": 10,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          23,\n          14,\n          38\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Adverbs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 7,\n        \"max\": 33,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          21,\n          7,\n          13\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
